**What do you mean by RTOS?**
Real Time Operating System (RTOS) is an operating system that is used for real-time applications i.e., for those applications where data processing should be done in a fixed and small measure of time. It performs much better on tasks that are needed to be executed within a short time. It also takes care of execution, monitoring, and all-controlling processes. It also occupies less memory and consumes fewer resources. 

Types of RTOS:

Hard Real-Time
Firm Real-Time
Soft Real-Time
